# Discrete Scroll

Fix for MacOS's scroll wheel problem for mice. Fork of project [here] (https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll)
It runs in the background and allows you to scroll 3 lines with each tick of the
wheel.

It needs to be run each time you boot. If you want this to be automatic you
may go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items` and add
`DiscreteScroll` to the list. If you want to undo the effect you may launch
Activity Monitor, search for `DiscreteScroll` and force it to quit.
